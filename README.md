## Description
![tech-blog-post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmng/Tech-Blog-MVC/main/assets/images/tech-blog-post.png)


This is a web application built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The application allows users to view and post articles on various technology-related topics. The application is built using the following technologies:

    Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
    Database: MySQL, Sequelize

The application is divided into three main components:

    Model: responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD operations on the data.
    View: responsible for displaying the data to the user and handling user input.
    Controller: responsible for handling the logic of the application and coordinating between the model and the view.
